Description:
ML, second lab.
Neural network that trains to identify road signs.
X_train - pictures data (amount, height, width, pixel values).
target - label names.
As a result of the training I got accuracy 90%.
The data is tested by parts, therefore we can see that accuracy is different.

How to run:
1. Google Colab -> Open Notebook -> Pechura02.ipynb 
2. Download train.pickle, valid.pickle, labels.csv to Google Drive
3. Run every code block
